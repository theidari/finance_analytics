<h3>Introduction and Research Objectives</h3>
<p align="justify">
Financial institutions face a significant risk known as credit risk, which refers to the possibility of borrowers or counterparties defaulting on a loan and causing financial loss to the lender. To mitigate this risk, lenders evaluate the creditworthiness of borrowers through a process called credit risk classification, which assesses the likelihood of default. Effective credit risk classification is crucial for lenders to make well-informed decisions and efficiently manage their portfolio. <b>This project's objective is to create a machine learning-based credit risk classification model</B>.</p>
